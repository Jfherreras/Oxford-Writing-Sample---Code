# Oxford-Writing-Sample---Code

### This hub contains the replication code for my MPhil Economics application at University of Oxford. The document referenced as writing sample is "Semi-structural model on developing countries after COVID-19 shock: The Colombian Case". In order to run the code you must have installed Matlab and IRIS toolbox, the code was made using the 2021b matlab version and the 20211222 IRIS version. It is recomended to have the same version of IRIS and a updated version of matlab.
### The running routine can be found in the main.m file, consistent with three files necessary to run the writing sample analyses. There are auxiliar files in the hub that are called from the main files.
