# Oxford-Writing-Sample---Code

### This hub contains the replication code for my MPhil Economics application at University of Oxford. The document referenced as writing sample is "Can RBC Models Replicate the COVID-19 Shock on Developing Countries? A Sustainability Debt Approach for the Colombian Case". In order to run the code you must have installed Matlab and Dynare toolbox, the code was made using the 2021a matlab version and the 6.2.3 Dynare version.
